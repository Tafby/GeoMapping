# GeoMapping Writeup

### Things I learned
##### How to parse json using Codable
##### All the details of Mapkit, annotations, etc.
##### How to use a navigation controller to navigate views
##### I learned so much while doing this project! I wasn't sure how to parse JSON in Swift, because I've never had to do that before. I also never used Mapkit before, I didn't know how to add points to the map, and showing the details using navigation controllers for the views.




### Things I would do if I had more time
##### Choose the users location instead of hard coding Seattle - I ended up hard coding a location, so that I didn't have to keep zooming in to see all of the annotations on the map
##### Error handeling: Missing data, HTTP errors, etc. - I don't really have much error handling, so given more time i'd like to add that. 


### Shortcomings
##### Organization of code - I know the organization of the code could definitly be better. I am still learning the proper way to organize files, func, etc
##### Details page styling - The details page could look much better, I had some trouble with stackviews and ending up using only Uilabels
##### Best practices - I've learned a lot of new things during this project and had to read a lot of different posts, documentation, and youtube videos. I'm not sure what what I did was actually best practice, but I'm learning!
